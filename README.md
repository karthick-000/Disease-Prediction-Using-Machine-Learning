# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Create a Python ML model to predict disease likelihood using classification algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, SVM). Analyze symptoms, test results, age, gender, and lifestyle. Train on labeled medical data, evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, handle imbalanced data and missing values.
